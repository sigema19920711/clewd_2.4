## Requirements

nodejs>=20.4.*

---

## Defaults

### SettingName: (DEFAULT)/opt1/opt2

 1. AdaptClaude: (false)/true
    * tries to make human/assistant prompts uniform between endpoints
    * effective both with streaming on and off now
    * __true *might* be bad for jailbreaks__, as no Assistant/Human is sent and it might be seen as sample dialogue instead of a direct order [see this](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-troubleshooting-checklist#the-prompt-is-formatted-correctly)
    - Human->H
    - Human<-H
    - Assistant->A
    - Assistant<-A

 2. AntiStall: (false)/1/2
    * no effect when using streaming
    * 1 sends whatever was last when exceeding size (might have some spicy things but impersonations as well)
    * 2 sends a usable message where the bot actually stopped talking

 3. ClearFlags: (false)/true
    * possibly snake-oil

 4. DeleteChats: (false)/true
    * for privacy, auto deletes your conversations after each reply
    * **if set to true, will also wipe old conversations on startup!**
    * no effect if RetryRegenerate is set to true

 5. PassParams: (false)/true
    * true will send the temperature you set on your frontent
    * only values under <=1
    * this could get your account banned
    * if clewd stops working, set to false

 6. PreventImperson: (true)/false
    * trims the bot reply immediately if he says "Human:" or "H:"
    * making it so it doesn't hallucinate speaking as you (chance of missing some spicy things)
    * it's probable this will trigger before AntiStall if you have that on

 7. PromptExperiment: (true)/false
    * an alternative way to send your prompt to the AI
    * experiment before setting to false

 8. RecycleChats: (false)/true
    * reuses the same chat on the website, based on the first prompt
    * false is less likely to get caught in a censorship loop

 9. RetryRegenerate: (false)/true
    * uses the AI's own retry mechanism when you regenerate on your frontend
    * instead of a new conversation
    * experiment with it

 10. StripAssistant: (false)/true
    * might be good IF your prompt/jailbreak itself ends with Assistant: 

 11. StripHuman: (false)/true
    * bad idea without RecycleChats, sends only your very last message
